            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>TItus Oats,</hi> the Infamous Subject of the Diſcourſe of this Age, (whoſe deteſtable Memory, together with the Villany of thoſe that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted him, and folly of thoſe that believed will be the Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Future Ages) was born at <hi>Okam</hi> in the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi> of mean Parentage: His Father was one <hi>Samuel Oats</hi> born at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and brought up there in Weaving <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuff, the chief Manifacture of that Town; in the time of Civil Broyls, he ſtep'd from the Loom into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, where he retailed Sedition and Nonſenſe to the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them a Famous Preacher, and a well Gifted Brother; he was not content to give thoſe of his Tribe common Waſhing, but ſouced and douced them ſo that he drowned a Holy Siſter in the dipping, for the which he nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped Hanging afterwards: when the King came in, he wheeled about with the Times, and got a Benefice at <hi>Hastings</hi> which he loſt for his Miſdemeanors and ſuſpicion of <hi>Perjury</hi> againſt Old Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> and came here to <hi>London,</hi> and dyed at the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> ſome two years ago, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there ſeveral years under vehement ſuſpition of <hi>Adultery;</hi> I ſhould not here rake into his Aſhes, but to ſhew that <hi>Titus Oats</hi> (as the Proverb ſays) <hi>Was the bad Egg of an ill Crow,</hi> and that he was fitted by his depraved Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Villanies he has ſince Committed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> till he was five years of age was much troubled with <hi>Convulſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> and ſmall hopes of Life; but afterwards growing ſtronger, was brought up by his Father from <hi>Okam</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where in that time he was ſo Famous for Lying amongſt his Companions, that ſeverals did preſage his future Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and that one time or another, if he was not taken off by the hand of Juſtice, he would put whole Kingdoms in <hi>Convulſions.</hi> He went for ſome time to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, but profited little in Learning, his Genius being wholly bent to baſeneſs and Villany: Afterwards when his Father had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by his ſeeming Conformity a Benefice at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> he took his hopeful Sprig, <hi>Titus</hi> down with him, and Baptized him at the Age of 12 years, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome principal People of the Town for Godfathers and Godmothers, after he had continued ſome few years with his Father at <hi>Haſtings;</hi> he was ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> where he was equally remarkable for his <hi>dulneſs</hi> and <hi>debauchery,</hi> he giving there a moſt remarkable Inſtance of his Roguery. He bought a Gown of a poor Taylor, and when he was Dun'd for the Money, he ſwore before his Tutor that he would take the Sacrament upon it that he had pay'd him; being asked by his Tutor how he came by ſo much Money, ſince all Money paſt through his hands, he ſaid it was privatly ſent him by his Mother by a Carrier, and Named him; the Carrier afterwards being called, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew <hi>Oats,</hi> nor any thing of the Matter. <hi>Oats</hi> was now but a freſh man as to his ſtanding in the Univerſity, but a Maſter of Arts in Lying and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: After he had ſtaid ſome ſmall time in the Univerſity, being Notorious for all ſorts of Debaucheries; he was called home by his Father to be his <hi>

                  </gap>itar</hi> at <hi>Hastings,</hi> his Father by this means preventing his being expelled the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he having neither Wit nor Learning, preſently became the Scandal of the Pulpit, inſomuch that the Fiſher-Women pulled him out of the Pulpit, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his abode at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> he was always quarrelling, and by Lies and Falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, ſetting Neighbours by the Ears, and afterwards Notoriouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwore himſelf in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> Junior, which is related by people wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all Credit, as follows.</p>
            <p>There happened to be a Quarrel between Young Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſo;</hi> upon which <hi>Oats</hi> was heard to ſay, that he would have the Lives of ſome of that Family in a ſhort time, the Father Old <hi>Samuel Oats</hi> ſwore Treaſon againſt Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> Senior, and ſo made him be ſent for up to <hi>London</hi> in the Interim. <hi>Titus</hi> ſwore a deteſtable <hi>Crime</hi> againſt Young <hi>Parker,</hi> ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the <hi>Church-Paroch:</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> Senior quickly got quit, becauſe the thing was found to be but mere malice, but it went harder with <hi>Parker</hi> Junior, for it came to the dangerous Event of a Tryal: but at the Tryal, Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> Junior proved by ſeveral Witneſſes, that he was at another place at that day, and that <hi>Maſons</hi> and other Workmen working about the <hi>Church,</hi> it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to commit ſuch an offence without being Diſcovered by them; upon which Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> Junior at laſt was quit, and <hi>Oats</hi> was preſently clap'd up in the <hi>Goal</hi> in his place, for ſpeaking ſcandalous things of Mr. <hi>Parker;</hi> there he continued a conſiderable time, but at laſt got a <hi>Certiorary</hi> to be removed to <hi>Dover</hi> one of the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> (he pretending he could have no Juſtice there, becauſe the <hi>Parkers</hi> were the chief Magiſtrats of the Town) there after ſome time he got out, and it is generally reported that he broke the Priſon, and ſo got to <hi>London;</hi> when he was at <hi>London</hi> he found himſelf at a great loſs, and ſo betook himſelf to his old Trade of Lying and Swearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> pretended he had made a Diſcovery of a <hi>Church,</hi> of which his Grace <hi>Henry</hi> late DUKE of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> he ſaid was Lawful Patron, and ſo he made Friends to his Grace, who promiſed him the Benefice in caſe he could make an Effectual Diſcovery, and in the Interim he gave him for ſome moneths, the Title of one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175946:2"/>of his Honorary <hi>Chaplains,</hi> but that project failing, he then began to pretend ſcruples in points of Religion, and that he was not well ſatisfied with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> Doctrine, <hi>and ſhe as little with his Practice and Example.</hi> After he had Diſcourſed ſome Members of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> he was as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended all on Fire to be joyned to it and reſolved to become a new man, and ſo at laſt he was admitted; then nothing would ſerve his turn, but he would needs become an Apoſtle, and reduce all as he ſaid to the Antient Faith; thoſe whom he tranſacted this Affair with being wholly ignorant of his former flagitious Life, were prevailed with, by his ſeeming Zeal to give him Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for the Engliſh Seminary at <hi>Vallodolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Titus Ambroſius;</hi> There he had not been long, but he gave many evident Proofs of his Incorrigible Nature and Blockiſhneſs; ſo being a conſtant Quarreller, and <hi>Combatant</hi> with the Servants and found altogether unfit to proceed any farther, after ſome two Months time he was diſmiſſed that <hi>Colledge,</hi> and took Ship at <hi>Bilboe,</hi> and ſo came for <hi>England,</hi> never coming near <hi>Salamanca,</hi> of which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſity he pretended to be a Doctor.</p>
            <p>After he came into <hi>England</hi> he began to be very troubleſome to his Romiſh Acquaintance, ſtill pretending great Zeal, and that he miſcarried at <hi>Vallodolid</hi> only becauſe he did not underſtand the Humour of the <hi>Spainards,</hi> who were ſuperiors of that Colledge; and ſo at laſt he prevailed with them to give him a ſecond Recommendation to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> hoping he ſhould give them better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in a Seminary of all Engliſh; and there he was received by the Name of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> a Name that ſomething ſquared to his Atchievements; for he killed as many men almoſt as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and that by the ſame Inſtrument, the <hi>Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſs,</hi> (and after ſet Fire on the <hi>Foxes</hi> Tails:) He came thither about <hi>December</hi> 1677. having been but the <hi>Summer,</hi> before at <hi>Vallodolid;</hi> he had not been long there, but he began to be as remarkable as he had been at <hi>Vallodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid:</hi> The Boyes for his folly and ſtupidneſs flocking about him as ſmall Birds do about an <hi>Owle,</hi> ſo that he was judged by all very unfit to go on to higher Studies, not being able to ſpeak two words of true <hi>Latin,</hi> as is evident by what was proved lately in Court againſt him, and by his own eſſaying to read the Year of our Lord, out of figures into Latin words; and beſides he was very proud and diſobedient, ſlighting the Diſcipline of the Houſe, and perpetually murmuring and ſpeaking ill of the <hi>Royal Family;</hi> ſo that at laſt they reſolved to diſmiſs him, having received his Character from <hi>Vallodolid;</hi> accordingly he was turned out about the middle of <hi>June</hi> 1678.</p>
            <p>There is one thing very remarkable happened the Night before his Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>There is by Relation a private <hi>Oratory</hi> in the Seminary where the Students do their privat Devotions; there being there an Altar and a Crucifix, one of the Superiors of the Houſe coming late to do his Devotion, obſerved that Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was got upon the Altar, and his hand upon the hand of the Crucifix; he asked him what he was doing, he replyed he was taking leave of Jeſus Chriſt; at his Diſmiſſion he ſaid to ſeveral of the Students, he would be revenged of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to the full, for denying him Entrance into their Order, and for turning him out of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> both which it ſeems he has in great part performed. After he came over into <hi>England</hi> again, he went ſculking up and down the Town among the Romaniſts, and was very troubleſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetually begging ſomething for a poor Student and a converted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who had voluntarily left a great Benefice, for to Embrace the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith,</hi> which moved the Charity of ſeveral; to thoſe that he thought were no great Friends of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> he made great complaints, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175946:3"/>them ſore; he told ſome of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (who afterwards by the Virtue of his Oath were Executed,) that if they would not by ſuch a time furniſh him with ſuch a ſum of <hi>Money,</hi> they ſhould all repent it; they knowing their own Conſcience, looking on him as a mere Vagabond and Scoundrel, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he ſaid, knowing his Majeſties Clemency, and never ſuſpecting that he would take ſuch a Diabolical Courſe as ſwearing of Treaſon, but only inform of them as being Prieſts: <hi>Oats</hi> in the mean time was Caballing with Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's generally ſuppoſed that <hi>Tongue</hi> drew up his <hi>Narrative: Oats</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> as you have heard for ſometime could furniſh them with Names of ſeveral; but they drew up the Method of the pretended Treaſon, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it afterwards according as they found the pulſe of the Nation beat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they thought all things were ready for a ſham Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and ſo was the <hi>Brat</hi> Midwifed into the World, which after by the inveterate Malice of ſome, and the Folly and Madneſs of others; grew in a ſhort time into that great Gyant that like another <hi>Goliah</hi> defyed the <hi>Armys of the living Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the ſitting of the Parliament which was in <hi>October</hi> following, <hi>Titus</hi> came into that Credit, that at the Interceſſion of the Houſe of Commons; he had Ten Pounds a Week allowed him and a Guard, which Penſion was continued till after the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, where at the Tryal of <hi>Stephen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Oats</hi> ſet up for an Evidence againſt the King, and at his return was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Court; then he went and herded himſelf among the Factious Party of the City, where he Caballed, but was never truſted in the great Deſign; becauſe as Coll. <hi>Rumſey</hi> ſaid, he was too great a Rogue; however they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him very well, but his credit ſunk lower and lower, every day; and was quite ruined upon the Diſcovery of the <hi>Phanatick Plot:</hi> The <hi>Summer</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he was clapt up into the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> upon an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt our preſent King, where he has behaved himſelf very inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and talked very baſely of the Royal Family, which by the Diſcovery of his pretended Plot, he pretended to have a great kindneſs for; this <hi>Term,</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> and alſo upon the 10th he was found out to be a great <hi>Impoſter,</hi> and to have falſely Perjured himſelf by above threeſcore Evidences, many of them Proteſtants; for which he is now to ſuffer ſeveral Penalties, Notoriouſly known to the World.</p>
